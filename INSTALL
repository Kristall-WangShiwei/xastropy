Installation instructions for xastropy.

The following assumes you use Anaconda to install Python.
It also assumes you will use Python 2.7

1.  Install Python with Anaaconda

2.  Install xastropy with git from github
  git clone https://github.com/profxj/xastropy.git
  cd xastropy
  sudo python setup.py develop
  
3. Update astropy

  If you have the version from Anaconda, wipe that:

     conda remove astropy
     git clone https://github.com/profxj/astropy.git   [in ~/local/Python]
     cd astropy
     sudo python setup.py develop

     You may need to do this before executing setup:
        sudo git clean -fxd

4.  Update/install specutils

  At present, you may need my fork. So, scrub any other version you have and do:

     git clone https://github.com/profxj/specutils.git
     cd specutils
     sudo python setup.py develop
     cd specutils
     git pull origin specwcs_log
     git checkout specwcs_log
